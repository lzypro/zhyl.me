            <p class="body-text work-description-paragraph">Simplifying complexity has always been at the forefront of SmartX’s product design philosophy. Their constant investment in design makes the product experience much better than their competitors. However, it’s never easy to help potential users experience their products. Previously they’ve tried blog posts and instructional videos.</p>
            <p class="body-text work-description-paragraph">The problem with reading articles is even the most detailed one can hardly enable users to experience the actual hands-on feeling. And the cost of producing high quality video is just too high. For this reason, SmartX team developed a web-based screen recording tool that generates interactive programs with step-by-step prompts. I designed the experience of the content generated by the tool in collaboration with the product team. We have also worked together to design a community page that is closely related to the Product Tour.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="body-text fp-4">In the field of IT infrastructure, a complex trial process not only affects perceptions of products — it also creates a heavy reliance on salespeople. No matter ordinary users, engineers, maintainers or resellers, they all want to try the products in a simple and clear way.</p>
        <img class="visualize-goal" src="/product-tour-and-smartx-community/image/visualize-goal.jpg" alt="Image helps on visualizing of the goal">
        <div class="initial-goals">
            <h3 class="paragraph-title pt-4">Initial Goals</h3>
            <p class="body-text fp-ig">During the kick-off phase, the product manager defined the following goals in the document:</p>
        </div>
        <ol class="goal-list body-text">
            <li class="goal-list-item">Provides demonstrations of installation, deployment and frequently used features of CloudTower.</li>
            <li class="goal-list-item">Anyone can view the tutorials without signing in.</li>
            <li class="goal-list-item">The tutorial is divided into multiple scenarios and tasks. Each task adopts an instructional approach. Once every task is finished, the user is guided to continue next one.</li>
            <li class="goal-list-item">Records user cookies in the browser and saves the progress of each scenario and task. After leaving the browser, the user can pick up the previous step when returning.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="process-title-2">
            <h5 class="subtitle">Original Prototype</h5>
            <h4 class="process-title-text">Develop the concept and basic flow.</h4>
        </div>
        <p class="body-text fp-5">When developing the concept I tried 2 different directions. One of them is to provide a similar feel to video streaming service like Netlix, through a strongly immersive interface. The other one is to provide more information by textual explanations to help users understand the product inside and out.</p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <p class="body-text fp-6">After discussions with product managers and the CEO, we went with first direction and moved forward with the design.</p>
        <div class="process-title-3">
            <h5 class="subtitle">Explore</h5>
            <h4 class="process-title-text">Varients of the landing page.</h4>
        </div>
        <p class="body-text fp-7">After developing the initial concept and basic flow, I started to experiment with the design of the overview page. I tested different styles, colors, head image and layouts. Here below are some of those attempts.</p>
        <img class="varients-of-landing-page" src="/product-tour-and-smartx-community/image/varients-of-landing-page.png" alt="Varients of landing page">
        <div class="process-title-4">
            <h5 class="subtitle">Finalize</h5>
            <h4 class="process-title-text">In-depth and detailed work overall.</h4>
        </div>
        <p class="body-text fp-8">We have settled on the design of overview page after several experiments and discussions. Then I designed various states of the page, buttons and cards, and also adapted the design to mobile screens.</p>
        <img class="detailed-work" src="/product-tour-and-smartx-community/image/detailed-work.png" alt="Varients of landing page">

            <h3 class="paragraph-title pt-5">Little Detail</h3>
            <p class="body-text fp-9">Because we wanted to use a white bottom bar while making the OS interface distinct from the tutorial's control bar, we added a green border around the edges.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="little-detail-1-2"></div>
        <div class="process-title-5">
            <h5 class="subtitle">Refine</h5>
            <h4 class="process-title-text">Covers, covers.</h4>
        </div>
        <p class="body-text fp-10">After finishing all the designs, we were still not entirely satisfied with the covers. Perfect cover here should fullfill two conditions — on the one hand, these covers need to reflect the content of the demo; on the other hand, they need to be abstract enough to be seperated from the rest of the website.</p>
        <video class="covers-video" src="/product-tour-and-smartx-community/video/covers-video.mp4" autoplay loop playsinline></video>
        <div class="seperator s-4"></div>
        <h2 class="section-title st-3" id="community">Community</h2>
        <div class="process-title-6">
            <h5 class="subtitle">Flow</h5>
            <h4 class="process-title-text">A collection of touch points and resources.</h4>
        </div>
        <p class="body-text fp-11">Considering the habits and preferences of Chinese users, SmartX did not plan to build a community as an open public space in the beginning. Instead, our expectation was to start with small group chats and engage users with rich community resources. Thus the challenge lies in how to organize the multiple forms of content and the relationship between each of them.</p>

            <p class="body-text fp-12">To bring a sense of ceremony to the download, I designed this icon for CloudTower installation package.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title st-4" id="other-works">Other Works</h2>
        <p class="body-text fp-13">During my year at SmartX, I have also designed the label feature & large display mode for CloudTower, the success stories and solution pages for the website, the logo for IOMesh, and an introduction page for hyperconvergence.</p>
